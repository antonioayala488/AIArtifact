# Reflection — Community Food Bank Ops (Capstone Artifact)

## AI Brainstorming Summary
I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas that **combine business value and technical capability**.  
We explored different directions — from portfolio websites to non-profit operational tools — and landed on the **Food Bank Operations App**, because:
- It represents **real business process improvement** (donation management, scheduling).
- It can be built **entirely client-side** but still shows strong architecture.
- It ties directly to **help-desk and data analytics** skills from my CIS background.

AI helped draft the structure, interface, and even the color palette.  
I guided the model by specifying requirements such as “non-profit context,” “offline-ready,” and “dashboard with KPIs.”

## Why I Chose This Artifact
I wanted an artifact that:
- **Delivers real business value** to an organization.
- Demonstrates my **technical proficiency** in front-end web technologies.
- Shows how **AI can accelerate development** while keeping me in control of the logic and workflow.

The Food Bank Ops app does exactly that — it’s functional, installable, and serves a purpose any small non-profit can relate to.

## What Worked Well
- **Rapid prototyping:** Using AI for scaffolding saved days of setup.
- **Clean architecture:** The final version uses only HTML, CSS, and JS — no dependencies.
- **Offline capability:** The service worker integration turned it into a real PWA.
- **Readable, maintainable code:** AI-generated code was refined by me for clarity.

---

## What Didn’t Work Initially
- The early AI drafts were too focused on portfolios and lacked operational realism.
- Data modeling for inventory aggregation required manual debugging.
- I had to manually adjust the CSV parsing logic for edge cases (quotes, commas).

---

## What I Learned
- **AI excels as a creative accelerator** — but it needs precise prompts and human validation.
- Effective AI collaboration feels like **pair programming**: I drive the problem definition and testing, the model provides speed and scaffolding.
- By grounding AI output in real business value (not aesthetics), the result becomes both technically sound and mission-driven.

**Conclusion:**  
This artifact proves how AI can enable rapid, impactful digital transformation for non-profits — producing measurable operational value while showcasing applied technical skill.
